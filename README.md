I’m an Italian astronomy and space popularizer and a podcaster.

Being an astronomy and space nerd didn't improve my social skills as a kid. But it sure gave me breadth and depth in these fields. As a young man, unique experiences provided further insight. And my social skills got a little better, too.

I worked in astronomy and space outreach and education.


## Programming

I’m no professional developer, just a hobby programmer.

I started playing with and programming computers in the early 1980s. This adventure led me to read about and experiment with many programming languages and environments, from Z-80 and MC-68000 Assembly to Lisp and Python.
